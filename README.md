Welcome to the Python Code Repository! This repository contains a collection of Python functions for various tasks, ranging from sorting algorithms to mathematical computations. Each function serves a specific purpose and is designed to be efficient and easy to understand. Let's take a quick tour of the functions available in this repository:

Bubble_sort
The Bubble_sort function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This function allows you to sort lists of numbers in ascending order.

Factorial_function_using_the_recursive_format
The Factorial_function_using_the_recursive_format function calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using the recursive approach. It demonstrates how a function can call itself to break down a problem into smaller subproblems until reaching a base case.

Industrial_time_converter
The Industrial_time_converter function is designed to convert industrial time representations to conventional time. It enables you to convert time in a format like "15:30" to "3:30 PM" for easier readability and understanding.

Leap_year_checker
The Leap_year_checker function helps you determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. It follows the rules for leap years: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.

Prime_number_generator
The Prime_number_generator function generates prime numbers up to a given limit. It efficiently identifies prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, allowing you to find all prime numbers in a specified range.

Sring_reverser in python
The Sring_reverser function is a simple utility that reverses a given string. It demonstrates how to manipulate strings and create reversed versions of the input.

factorial_function_using_the_loop_format
The factorial_function_using_the_loop_format function computes the factorial of a given positive integer using the iterative loop approach. It is an alternative method to calculate factorials without recursion.

I hope you find these Python functions useful and educational. Each function is documented with comments to clearly explain its functionality and usage. Feel free to explore the code, use the functions in your projects, and contribute to the repository by adding new functionalities or improvements.

Happy coding!
